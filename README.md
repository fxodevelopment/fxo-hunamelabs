(NOT UPDATED)

I have made a Humane Labs robbery script which is meant to give chemicals.
Most things can be changed in the config, you can see more on Tebex
If there are any questions, join the discord which is linked.

Some of the things you see in the preview are in Danish, but this has been changed in the script.
